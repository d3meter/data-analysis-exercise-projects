## Data-Analysis: Exercise projects
These are practical projects where I used material from the course *"Statistics for Data Science and Business Analysis" (365 Careers)*.

Since the course is basically focused on statistical theory and the practical exercises are "only" available in Excel, I thought it was appropriate to solve them on a higher level, using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** or Power BI. Here are the Python implementations.

In addition to the processing and presentation of the data, conclusions are of course included at the end of each section.
